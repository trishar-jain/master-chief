First, in a food processor blend the cookies.
Next, whisk the milk and the pudding powder in a saucepan on high heat until it boils.
After that, mix your crushed cookies with the pudding.
Then, set out your 4 glasses in which you will put the pudding. In that, put the pudding, decorate with the gummy worms, and sprinkle with some more crushed cookies on the top.
Lastly, put this in the refrigerator for at least 2 hrs until its cold.
Enjoy!!
